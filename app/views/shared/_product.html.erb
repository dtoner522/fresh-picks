    <h2>What's in the box?</h2>
    <p>The box will be full of a wide range of veg, herbs, and leaves. Each week will have variation depending on whatâ€™s in season. Staples such as onions, carrots and tomatoes will make regular appearances and there will be the occasional interesting/unique variety so you can feel all fancy and exotic, while keeping it local and sustainable.
    <br>
    Every item in the box will be picked fresh, ensuring the most nutrient rich produce at the peak of its flavour. So no rock-hard tomatoes, no sad looking leaves staring at you through a plastic bag. In fact, no plastic bags at all!
